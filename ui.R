                              <p style="align-text:center; padding=0px;">In late August of 1996, a wildfire raged through the Boise foothills. The fire was started by someone practicing target shooting around the Military Reserve Park. Eventually, the fire burned over 15,000 acres. After the fire had scorched the vegetation on the slopes, the city residents feared severe mudslides. Just a few decades prior, a devastating fire had swept through the foothills in 1959. The loss of vegetation mixed with a heavy rainstorm caused horrific mudslides that damaged and destroyed many people’s homes</p>

                              <p style="align:center;">Let’s think about how land managers can plan to rehabilitate an area in order to speed up the recovery of big sagebrush. There are several things to consider. Cheatgrass, an invasive species, has spread widely throughout the Great Basin and the Boise foothills. Cheatgrass can increase the chance of wildfires since it burns easily and spreads fire for longer distances. Because cheatgrass fuels intense fires, this can drastically change how big sagebrush recovers. You can see this effect by moving the Cheatgrass Slider in the Explore Recovery section.</p>
                              <p style="align:center;">Thankfully, management intervention and ecological restoration can greatly facilitate the recovery. Compare the predicted abundance of big sagebrush for 2036 under two scenarios:</p>

                                  <p >(i) Without Cheatgrass (slider set to 0)<p>
                                  <p >(ii) With moderate Cheatgrass invasion (slider set to 0.5)</p>
                                </div>
                              <p style="align:center;">Keep the sliders for growth rate and carrying capacity parameters set to 0.1 and 20, respectively (make sure the ‘Add Chance Events’ box is blank).</p>
                              <p style="align:center;"> Write a letter to various land managers with a recommendation for how to respond to cheatgrass invasion. In your proposed restoration project, provide options restoration crews can focus on to compensate for cheatgrass invasion. You will need to explain and defend your findings for future sagebrush recovery.</p>

Among the natural wildfires, lightning strikes are one of the most common sources. Human-caused wildfires often start from negligence of campfires, smoking, vehicle sparks, and other activities.

                                <h4>What Do We Mean by Sagebrush?</h4>
                                <p>There are more than ten species in the sagebrush steppe that we call sagebrush. The most common one, big sagebrush, spreads throughout the Intermountain West - from the Rockies in the East and Cascades and Sierra Mountains in the West. Big sagebrush is most likely seen from outside our windows or on hikes in Idaho landscapes. Despite being less common, species like black sagebrush and(or low sagebrush) are ecologically important plants too. For example, in winter times leaves of low sagebrush are an important source of food for sage grouse.</p>

                                <p>Sagebrush is an interesting species from the standpoint of its genes. Many big sagebrush plants have multiple copies of chromosomes in their cells. We call these kinds of plants

                                               Polyploidy is common in other plants too, particularly in those that are in agricultural use, but generally is not typical among animals. For example, wheat and strawberries from grocery stores are polyploids too!

                                <p>Golden eagles, sage sparrows, and badgers are just a few examples of animals that we find in the sagebrush steppe. Sage grouse is found exclusively in the Great Basin and nowhere else in the world, and it depends deeply on healthy sagebrush ecosystems. At different times of the year, we can also see the largest hawk in the United States, the ferruginous hawk, soaring above Idaho landscapes.

                         Andrii is a graduate student at BSU studying the ecology of big sagebrush and its interactions

                         Boise State University. If you have any thoughts or ideas about sagebrush and wildfires, we are 
                         always happy to chat about science, ecology, and local ecosystems.
